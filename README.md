# CSE548-Project4 (Phishing Simulation)
Web app to automate infrastructure setup for cybersecurity awareness evaluation in an organization

This project mainly aims to increase phishing awareness by providing a customized assessment to assess people's action in any given situation thereby improving an organization's ability to understand the level of cybersecurity awareness among its employees. 

## What?

 - One of the objective of organizations carrying out red team assessment is to know the weakness in the IT ecosystem which includes people and network. Organizations take every effort to improve there perimeter security and patch the vulnerabilities found but people remain the weakest link. Phishing plays vital role in understanding the security-awareness of employee. 
- With this tool, an organization can set up a customised phishing website that looks very similar to the organization's website in order to evaluate the level of cybersecurity awareness among its employees. Once the website is setup, the admin can send emails with the link to the phishing website to the employees in the organization with one click. A REST API endpoint is exposed to show which employee actually clicks the link and logins on the phishing website. Once it is known which users are not that aware of possible cybersecurity attacks, the organization can spend resources to train them.
